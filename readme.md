# Linear Regression 101

Welcome to linear regression 101! In this repo, I go over

1. Linear Regression
2. Batch Gradient Descent

To help explain both concepts, I have provided a short write up, as well as a code demo to help explain both concepts. 

[Write Up](https://github.com/Adriank2001/LinearRegression101/blob/master/linearregression.md): I provide a short write up specifically about the linear regression model, how it is used, and how model parameters can be set using batch gradient descent.

[Code](https://github.com/Adriank2001/LinearRegression101/blob/master/linearregressioncode.ipynb): I provide annotated code which shows linear regression being used on a simple dataset. I also show how batch gradient descent iteratively improves on the model parameters to better fit the data.
